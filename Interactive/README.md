This portion of the project was ROUGH. It took me several days of headache just to get the template to work properly for me. Using both Stefano's and the version provided by our classmate Cam. Neither wanted to work with my computer at home. After finally getting in some time at the Game Studio lab I was able to figure out the issues surronding the template and actually get working.
